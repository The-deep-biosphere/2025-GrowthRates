# In situ microbial growth rates in deep-sea sediments

## WORK IN PROGRESS!!!!


This repository contains the integrality of the scripts and files needed to reproduce the data analysis presented in the aforementioned article. Note that the authors are in no case Unix/R/Julia professionals, and the code can certainly be written in a more idiomatic way. Do not hesitate to reach out for further help.


Sequences are deposited at on gene bank under the Bioprojekt [PRJNA784957](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA784957/).  
Other raw data is in the different directories in this repositories, and can be accessed here and here....
